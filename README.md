**Product page: https://www.omnect.io/home**

This module implements a web frontend and backend to provide omnect specific features in a local environment, where the device might not be connected to the azure cloud. In that case the device cannot be remotely controlled by [omnect-portal](https://cp.omnect.conplement.cloud/) and omnect-ui might be the alternative.
