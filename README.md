# omnect-ui

Product page: <www.omnect.io>

This module implements a web frontend and backend to provide omnect specific features in a local environment, where the device might not be connected to the azure cloud. In that case the device cannot be remotely controlled by [omnect-portal](https://cp.omnect.conplement.cloud/) and omnect-ui might be the alternative.

## Install omnect-ui

Since omnect-os is designed as generic OS, all specific or optional applications must be provided as docker images via azure iotedge deployment:

- deployment of omnect-ui docker image via omnect-portal to a device in field
- device must be online (at least once) in order to receive the deployment
- after a factory reset omnect-ui must be deployed again what requires a connection to azure cloud

### iotedge deployment

In case it is agreed, the omnect team takes care of providing omnect-ui as application in omnect-portal. Get into contact with <support@omnect.io> if interested.
